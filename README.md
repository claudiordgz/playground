Playground
==========

The purpose of this repository is to be my set of Workspaces for multiple implementations and learning initiatives. I can't survive without taking notes, mostly because I tend to come back to my notes in the future, but a tiny part of the reason is because I learn better when constructing the examples. I don't work well with only theory, thus, reading the wikipedia on R-Tree will most likely get me nowhere. 

###OpenGL

The OpenGL folder is an eclipse folder containing my code for OpenGL. In it I will be placing anything relating to coloring, rastering, and shading algorithms I can find. Implementation will be in C++ mostly.


###Euler

The Euler folder is a Haskell workspace, and as the name implies, its intention is to contain all the code related to the Euler Project problems. 

>Why Haskell?

I felt like learning it. I've plaid with Lisp, Prolog, and Scheme before but Haskell reminded me of Python so much I felt like home.
